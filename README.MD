🧾 POS SaaS Architecture (Multi-Tenant, Scalable, Secure)
This document outlines the production-ready architecture for a Point of Sale (POS) SaaS platform, designed for scalability, security, and flexibility. It supports multi-tenancy, fine-grained access control, and modular service development.

🧱 Tech Stack Overview
Layer Technology
Frontend (Web) React / Vue
Mobile App Native (Kotlin/Swift) or Flutter
API Gateway KrakenD
Authentication Keycloak
Authorization Permify (RBAC/ABAC/ReBAC)
Cache Layer Redis (Clustered / Sentinel)
Backend Services Go / Node / Python (your choice)
Databases PostgreSQL (per service, tenant-aware)
Observability Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Loki
CI/CD GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Helm, Terraform

🔐 Security Overview
✅ Authentication: Keycloak with OIDC, realm/group-based multi-tenancy

✅ Authorization: Permify for fine-grained RBAC, ABAC, and ReBAC

✅ Rate Limiting & API Security: Via KrakenD

✅ Secrets Management: Vault, Kubernetes secrets, or SealedSecrets

🧩 Multi-Tenancy Strategy
Concern Solution
Tenant Isolation Shared DB, shared schema with tenant_id columns
Tenant Context Injected via JWT claims and headers
AuthZ Enforcement Tenant-aware middleware + Permify policies
Keycloak Realm Mgmt Optional: realm-per-tenant or group-per-tenant

🧪 Observability & Monitoring
Tool Purpose
Prometheus Metrics collection from services
Grafana Dashboards for system health & KPIs
Loki Centralized logging

⚙️ CI/CD + Deployment
Tool Role
GitHub Actions Unit tests, linting, builds
ArgoCD GitOps continuous deployment
Helm Kubernetes app templating
Terraform Infrastructure as code
Kubernetes Container orchestration

⚡ Redis Caching
Used to reduce latency and load on databases:

Frequently accessed data (e.g., product catalog)

Session/token caching

Configurable TTL and eviction policy

Optional: Use Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster for HA

📋 Example Request Flow
User logs into Web or Mobile App → Auth via Keycloak

JWT with tenant_id, roles, and permissions is issued

Request hits KrakenD, validated and routed

KrakenD forwards to microservice (e.g., Inventory Service)

Permify is queried to check if action is allowed (RBAC/ABAC)

Data is fetched from DB or Redis if cached

Response is returned to client

🛡️ Resiliency Patterns
✅ Health checks (readiness/liveness)

✅ Graceful degradation via fallback APIs

✅ Rate limiting & DDoS protection via KrakenD

📦 Extensibility Tips
Add support for billing (e.g., Stripe) per tenant

Use feature flags (e.g., Unleash, LaunchDarkly)

Extend reporting with BigQuery/Snowflake pipelines

Optionally support GraphQL via BFF layer or alternative gateway
